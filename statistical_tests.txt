Outcomes of two models, one step ahead

Granger-Newbold:
    Not appropriate when models are nested
    test the errors of two regressions (WE, p 87)
    one step ahead forecasts
    are the two regressions equal, looks a sum of squares, loss is quadratic

Diebold-Mariano:
    Not appropriate when models are nested



Tests of structural change

Chow test:
    Test values before and after break (WE, p.104)

Parameter instability:

Endogenous breaks
